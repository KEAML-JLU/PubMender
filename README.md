# The Source Code of Biomedical Publication Recommender System **[Pubmender](https://www.keaml.cn:8081/)**

The `src` directory includes the source code of Pubmender's recommend engine's training module.

Due to capacity limit of github repository, we provide a sample of train data and pretrained word embeddings.

The dependencies of the source code are:

* python==2.7
* pytorch==0.3.1
